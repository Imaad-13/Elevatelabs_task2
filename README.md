# Phishing Detection Report: PayPal Email Case Study

## 📌 Objective
To analyze a suspicious PayPal-themed email and identify phishing indicators through manual inspection and standard phishing detection techniques.

## 🕵️ Summary of Phishing Indicators

| Indicator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Spoofed Email Address** | The sender address was `service.epayipal@outlook.com`, spoofing a legitimate PayPal email. |
| **Urgency in Language** | The subject line "Response required" creates pressure for immediate action. |
| **Suspicious Links** | Although links were not shown in full, they likely redirect to malicious phishing websites. |
| **No Personalization** | Uses generic greetings like "Dear customer" instead of the recipient’s actual name. |
| **Brand Imitation** | Uses PayPal logos and styling to create a false sense of legitimacy. |
| **Request for Login** | Encourages users to log in via the email, a common phishing tactic. |
| **Display Name vs Actual Email Mismatch** | The display name "service@intl.paypal.com" masks the real email `epayipal@outlook.com`. |

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
- Visual inspection of the email content
- Manual email header analysis
- Email preview through client
- Reference to phishing detection checklists

## 🧠 Conclusion
This email is a textbook example of phishing, leveraging urgency, branding deception, and spoofed sender identities to trick users into revealing login credentials. **Users are advised not to interact with such messages and should report them as phishing.**
